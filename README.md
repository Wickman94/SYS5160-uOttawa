This script performs system identification using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for a given differential equation by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the simulated system response and the model's response.

 Dependencies
==============
> Python
> NumPy
> SciPy


Instructions
============

  > Setup: Ensure all dependencies are installed.
> 
  > Define System & Model: In the script, the system is defined using its differential equation, and the model is represented as a transfer function with unknown parameters.

  > Objective Function: Modify the objective_function in the script to reflect your system's characteristics and the data you have.

  > PSO Configuration: Set up the PSO parameters like particle count, iterations, cognitive/social coefficients, and inertia weight.

  > Execution: Run the script. The PSO will optimize the parameters to fit your data.

  > Output: The script prints the best parameter set and the best fitness value (MSE).

Note
=================
The code uses simulated data. Replace this with actual system response data if available.
PSO parameters may need tuning based on your specific problem for optimal performance
